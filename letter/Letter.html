        I love you from the bottom of my heart, more so than from the roots of the earth, from the deepest parts of the ocean and to the moon and back.
        There isn't a day that passes without me thinking about you, you make me whole, you make me happy and you make me feel loved.
        I love your laugh, I love your cheerful smile that brings joy to my heart, I love your gorgeous owl eyes they shine brighter than the sun, 
        I love your beautiful face that brings even the mona lisa to tears, I love your alluring lucious lips that make a cute little heart shape in preperation of kissing.
        and of course i love your squishy lil booty! whicn not even the softest of pillows can compare.
        <br>
        <br>
        I look forward to spending the rest of my days with you and I am exicted for what the future holds no matter what it holds. We've beat more than a year
        of hard and painful dicstance however the hard and painful parts are becoming less and less as time goes on, our fighting has nothing but stopped to an almost complete standstill, 
        my childish actions have nothing but perished and my emotianal maturity and comforting ablities have impropved a lot. You of course have also improved a lot, you feel more safe around me 
        which enables you share your troubles with me so im able to comfort you when you need it and vise verse actually I feel really safe with you aswell, your previous unkindness and unfairness is virtually gone 
        aside from the monthly outbreak, although thats mostly because you're hangy xd. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Anyway I wish nothing but a continuing relationship with you where one day we'll meet and live the rest of our lives togheter, going on dates, going to movies, experiencing new things and 
        watching movies with snackies and couddles. I LOVE YOU SOSOSO MUCHHH!!!
        <br>
        <br>
        From your hubby and handsome man ;* ❤️</p>
